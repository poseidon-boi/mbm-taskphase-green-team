      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>I’m in Uganda, and we have a national election on Jan 15, 2026. During past elections, the internet usually 
        gets switched off nationwide, sometimes for days. Problem is… I’m on a 458-day Reddit streak. I know, first-world problem energy, but hear me out 😭
        streak is my daily routine. Scroll a bit, read comments, feel human. If the internet goes off, the streak dies.
        because I forgot. Not because I gave up. Just vibes and government decisions.
        Is there any way Reddit handles streaks in situations like nationwide outages? Or do I just accept my fate and pour one out for Day 459?
        Thanks in advance, and wish me luck.</p>

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>can we stop saying straight foward sub reddit name and check what the subreddit is about before mindlessly saying it. 
        (put suggestion as the flair, because im asking to have text company subreddit names and add 30+ and up letters in the 
        description needed so people wont leave it as blank without con

        anyone who says that is a MORON! they see sonic? r/sonic. they see mercy from overwatch? 
        r/mercy, even tho its not the focus point of it. one time, i saw a retard just saying r/venusflytrap to a meme 
        compile that somone wanted to image dump and the first image is a flytrap smoking a ciggarette, they didnt even 
        bother to scroll first. and please, check what the subreddits about before mindlessly sending it. one time i 
        posted a picture of a cleanly stacked uno arranging numbers and seperating the colors, somone said to post it 
        in r/UNO. i said "that might work" when i pressed it i relised the picture said "UNO" but blue. when i posted it, 
        it turns out to be "University of New Orleans". the poster is also to blame due to just saying "where do i post this?" 
        in the title, the 20+ word needed didnt help much because "where do i post this?" is 20, while it still dosent 
        give you any idea what it means, do they want to shitpost or serious post</p>

      <h3>Data Collection</h3>
      <p>I am the very model of a modern Major-General, 
        I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,
        I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historical
        From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical;
        I'm very well acquainted, too, with matters mathematical,
        I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,
        About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot o' news,
        With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.
        I'm very good at integral and differential calculus;
        I know the scientific names of beings animalculous:
        In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,
        I am the very model of a modern Major-General.
        I know our mythic history, King Arthur's and Sir Caradoc's;
        I answer hard acrostics, I've a pretty taste for paradox,
        I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of Heliogabalus,
        In conics I can floor peculiarities parabolous;
        I can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies,
        I know the croaking chorus from The Frogs of Aristophanes!
        Then I can hum a fugue of which I've heard the music's din afore,
        And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore.
        Then I can write a washing bill in Babylonic cuneiform
        And tell you ev'ry detail of Caractacus's uniform:
        In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,
        I am the very model of a modern Major-General. </p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>This is a section where i test out how to add an image with alt text.</p>
      <div class="image-and-caption">
        <img src="trialPic.jpg">
        <p class="caption">Figure 1: Trayee casually does a cartwheel.
          what happens if text here overflows? does it obey the borders i applied?
          i guess we'll find out when the text builds up enough to overflow.
