      <h2>Dr. Jonathan Müller</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p> Principal Scientist (Strain Development) at Solena Materials Limited<br>
        Date- 10/1/26<br>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-muller-phd-12b97b1a2/">LinkedIn</a>
        <br>
        <br>
       We reached out to Dr. Jonathan Muller to discuss his thesis on the
        synthesis of γ-decalactone and other terpenoids. Through this interaction
         we gained quite a few valuable insights into potential strategies for 
         improving yield by identifying the bottlenecks he encountered.
          We also investigated whether altering these enzymes or using a 
          different chassis could improve production after learning about 
          specific mutations in BM3 and thioesterase. He also discussed some
           of the practical difficulties he encountered while conducting his 
           experiments, which would have assisted us in creating our own strategy
            if we had chosen this project.</p>

        <h2>Dr. Mohammed Rasoul Sammandari</h2>
        <div class="dividerbar"></div>
        <p> Doctoral Student at Estonian University of Life Sciences<br>
           Date- 12/11/26 <br>
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-rasoul-s-b04824115/">LinkedIn</a>
            <br>
            <br>

           We reached out to him to understand the lab protocols 
           described in his paper, which were detailed and informative. 
           This also gave us valuable insights into the heterologous pathway, 
           further deepening our understanding of how the enzymes function.This
            was also done for one of the previous projects.</p>

      <h2>Dr. Zijay Tang</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>Co-Founder and CTO at Anthology<br>
        Date- 12/11/26<br>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tzu-chieh-tang/
">LinkedIn</a><br>
        
        <br>
        As a part of our Human Practices, we reached out to 
        Dr. Zijay Tang for one of our previous projects to gain
         insight to the practical limitations of the DEPCOS system
          for environmental sensing. He highlighted that the maintenance 
          of cellular activity with continuous nutrient availability and 
          proper temperature was the main factor that limited its lifetime. 
          He also explained that alginate-based shells need a constant supply 
          of ions like calcium to stay stable and avoid swelling. These insights 
          helped us better understand the trade-offs between biosafety, material
           stability, and long-term deployment.

      <h2>Companies</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>We reached out to several companies that produce our target product to understand the market, 
        including supply and demand dynamics. The main aim was to identify which industries use these 
        compounds the most and to learn about the challenges companies face during production and the 
        mechanism of its production process, so we can explore how our project could help address these 
        issues. We are currently awaiting their responses.
      <br><br>
      Some of the companies we tried reaching out to but haven't heard back from yet:- </p>

      <h2>Traders and Service Providers</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>Sent mail on :- 14-1-26 <br>
        We reached out to traders and select service providers to understand how frequently they 
        restock p-cuminaldehyde and cyclamen aldehyde, as well as their typical purchasing patterns 
        such as whether buyers prefer bulk or smaller quantities. We also aimed to identify demand 
        trends over the past few years and understand how these stakeholders manage procurement 
        and pricing strategies when market prices fluctuate. However, we have not yet received 
        responses from them.
