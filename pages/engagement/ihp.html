      <h2>Dr. Jonathan Müller</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>Date- 10/1/26 <br>
        We reached out to Dr. Jonathan Muller to discuss his thesis on the synthesis of γ-decalactone 
        and other terpenoids. Through this interaction we gained quite a few valuable insights into 
        potential strategies for improving yield by identifying the bottlenecks he encountered. We 
        also learned about specific enzyme mutations in BM3 and thioesterase and explored whether 
        modifying these enzymes or employing a different chassis could enhance production. 
        Additionally, he shared some of the practical challenges he faced during his experiments, 
        which would have helped us design our own approach had we picked this project.</p>

        <h2>Dr. Mohammed Rasoul Sammandari</h2>
        <div class="dividerbar"></div>
        <p>Date- 12-11-16 <br>
            We reached out to him to understand the lab protocols described in his paper, which were 
            detailed and informative. This also gave us valuable insights into the heterologous pathway, 
            further deepening our understanding of how the enzymes function.This was also done for one 
            of the previous projects.</p>

      <h2>Dr. Zijay Tang</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>As a part of our Human Practices, we reached out to Dr. Zijay Tang for one of our previous 
        projects to gain insight to the practical limitations of the DEPCOS system for environmental
        sensing. He highlighted that the maintenance of cellular activity with continuous nutrient 
        availability and proper temperature was the main factor that limited its lifetime. He also 
        explained that alginate-based shells need a constant supply of ions like calcium to stay 
        stable and avoid swelling. These insights helped us better understand the trade-offs between 
        biosafety, material stability, and long-term deployment.</p>

      <h2>Companies</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>We reached out to several companies that produce our target product to understand the market, 
        including supply and demand dynamics. The main aim was to identify which industries use these 
        compounds the most and to learn about the challenges companies face during production and the 
        mechanism of its production process, so we can explore how our project could help address these 
        issues. We are currently awaiting their responses.
      <br><br>
      Some of the companies we tried reaching out to but haven't heard back from yet:- </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Perfumax India</li>
        <li>Karnataka Aromas</li>
        <li>KK Aromas</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Traders and Service Providers</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>Sent mail on :- 14-1-26 <br>
        We reached out to traders and select service providers to understand how frequently they 
        restock p-cuminaldehyde and cyclamen aldehyde, as well as their typical purchasing patterns 
        such as whether buyers prefer bulk or smaller quantities. We also aimed to identify demand 
        trends over the past few years and understand how these stakeholders manage procurement 
        and pricing strategies when market prices fluctuate; however, we have not yet received 
        responses from them.

      <h2>Labs and Small Producer Companies</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <h4>Kelvin Natural Mint PVT LTD</h4>
      <p>Sent mail on :- 15-1-26 <br>
        We reached out to Kelvin Natural Mint PVT LTD, a small-scale producer of essential oils, 
        to understand the challenges they face in sourcing raw materials and maintaining consistent 
        product quality. We aimed to explore how fluctuations in supply chains impact their production 
        and whether our biosynthetic approach could offer a more reliable alternative. We are yet to 
        receive a response from them.</p>
      <h4>Karnataka Fine Chem</h4>
      <p>Dr. P Srihari <br> Chief scientist and chair, CSIR <br> Sent mail on :- 16-1-26 <br>
          We contacted them to better understand how these compounds are sourced and the common challenges 
          associated with using aldehydes in laboratory settings. We also inquired whether their 
          organization would be willing to advise us on our sustainable aldehyde production process; 
          however, we have yet to receive a response from them.</p>

      <h2>Professors</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <h4>Dr. Subbalaxmi S</h4>
      <p>Associate Professor <br> Department of Biotechnology <br> 
        Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal <br> Sent mail on :- 16-1-26 <br>
        She played a key role in helping us understand aldehyde extraction from organic solvents 
        and downstream processing strategies. She also provided valuable insights into the various 
        methods we could potentially employ, which were instrumental in designing our extraction 
        protocol.</p>

      <h4>Dr. Ramananda Bhat M</h4>
      <p>Professor | Department of Biotechnology <br>

        methods.</p>

      <h4>Dr. Divyashree</h4>
      <p>Associate Professor | Department of Biotechnology <br>
          Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal <br>
          Sent mail on :- 12-1-26 <br>
          She helped us understand how the dyes function and the various extracellularization 
          methods that could be employed. She also provided insights into how similar systems 
          typically operate and function.</p>

        She provided detailed insights into our plant diagnostics project, emphasizing the 
        importance of narrowing down stress response systems. By discussing both the strengths 
        and limitations of the project, she helped guide our decision on whether to pursue it 
        further.</p>
