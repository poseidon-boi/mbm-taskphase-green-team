         <h2>Survey</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>We conducted a survey to evaluate general awareness
         and public interest in our project. The objective 
         was to understand how people perceive perfume production 
         and to assess their response to perfumes produced via 
         biosynthetic methods, particularly whether this
          influences their perception of the product or
           affects their purchasing decisions. 
           This survey helped us gauge the potential 
           societal impact of our project and within 24 hours, 
           we received around 250 responses.</p>
     <div class="image-and-caption">

	<p class="caption"></p>
</div>

<br>
<p>From our interactions, we found that a lot of people
     use fragrant products every day, while only a few
      use them rarely. This shows that fragrances are a
       regular part of daily life and not just an occasional 
       luxury. Because these products are used so often, 
       making their production more sustainable is sure to
        have a large positive impact over time. This 
        further supported our decision to focus on
         developing environment friendly and scalable 
         methods for producing fragrance compounds.
</p>
  <div class="image-and-caption">
	<img src="hp2.jpeg">
	<p class="caption"></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Out of  the 313 responses, about 253 people (80.8%) 
    reported using perfumes and deodorants. Soaps and 
    shampoos were the next most commonly used fragrant
     products. This further stresses on the the importance 
     of developing sustainable methods for producing
      fragrance compounds.
</p>
 <div class="image-and-caption">

</div>
<br> 
<p>Most people (81.6%) know that fragrances are made
     chemically, which shows why we need greener, 
     bio-based ways to make them.</p>

<p>
   Most people (81.6%) know fragrances are made chemically. 
   When asked about making them with microbes, most said it didn’t
    change their view, 31% felt positive, and 9.9% 
    felt negative. This shows microbial production doesn’t 
    change perception much. 
</p>
  <div class="image-and-caption">
	<img src="hp5.jpeg">
	<p class="caption"></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Most people preferred fresh, aquatic and floral fragrances while 
    spicy scents seemed to be the least popular. Since cyclamen aldehyde
     has a floral and fresh character, our project aligns very well with consumer preferences.
     This therefore  increases its relevance and acceptance.</p>

          <h2>Companies</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>We reached out to several companies that produce our target product to understand the market, 
        including supply and demand dynamics. The main aim was to identify which industries use these 
        compounds the most and to learn about the challenges companies face during production and the 
        mechanism of its production process, so we can explore how our project could help address these 
        issues. We are currently awaiting their responses.

      <p><a href="https://perfumaxindia.in/">Visit</a></p>
      <p> Called on :- 18-1-26 <br>
          We contacted perfumax India, a wholesaler/distributer company 
          that gave us insights on the current trends and market 
          for aromatic aldehydes in India. From the information 
          they have given us, we have understood that in India, 
          aldehydes normally do not go beyond 3000 rupees per
           kilogram in general, so in order for us to commercialise
            our product, our focus must be on making it economical. 
            The supplier we spoke to also mentioned that the market 
            for aldehydes has been depleting in the recent years,
             however, he was unaware of the replacements used for 
             aromatic aldehydes when they were not available.

      <p>Sent mail on :- 14-1-26 <br>
        We reached out to traders and select service providers to understand how frequently they 
        restock p-cuminaldehyde and cyclamen aldehyde, as well as their typical purchasing patterns 
        such as whether buyers prefer bulk or smaller quantities. We also aimed to identify demand 
        trends over the past few years and understand how these stakeholders manage procurement 
        and pricing strategies when market prices fluctuate. However, we have not yet received 
        responses from them.

        chemical manufacturing, to understand the current challenges
         in their production process and to assess demand and supply dynamics.

          We contacted them to better understand how these compounds are sourced and the common challenges 
          associated with using aldehydes in laboratory settings. We also inquired whether their 
          organization would be willing to advise us on our sustainable aldehyde production process.
          However, we have yet to receive a response from them.</p>

      <p> Sent mail on :- 11-1-26 <br>
          KK Aromas is a company that manufactures and deals
           aroma chemicals, including cumin aldehyde and cyclamen aldehyde. 
           We reached out to this company in order to understand industry 
           perspectives on the production methods and challenges faced with respect
            to cuminaldehyde and cyclamen aldehyde. From the input they provided, 
            we were able to identify the primary consumers of these molecules in
             India, namely the incense industry. In India most aldehydes are
              imported due to better quality and cleaner notes. Further, indian
               industries focus more on cheap prices, which means we will have 
               to ensure our product is economically feasible in order for it to
                have a market in India. He gave us valuable insights  that helped 
                us understand our impact better, and did suggest a more popular 
                scent, d-limonene, for which unfortunately synbio production has
                 already been done.</p>

      <p> Sent mail on :- 11-1-26 <br>
          We reached out to bloggers and influencers to get to know their
           perspectives on sustainability,
           audience engagement with sustainable
            cosmetics and fragrances. Another aspect we 
            specifically asked them was about the attributes
             they typically look for in perfumes such as
              scent storytelling and performance. However, 
              they are yet to respond.

       <h2>Future HP Plans</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>
        We plan to talk to chemical and fragrance 
        companies that use these compounds to make
         perfumes and other scented products. 
         We will also reach out to social media
          influencers to spread awareness, 
          since our project focuses on sustainability 
          and protecting the environment. We aim to
           connect withgovernment bodies involved in
            the fragrance and aroma sector to understand 
            regulations and encourage safer alternatives.
             In addition, we will contact NGOs because our
              project can help reduce food waste and avoid
               the use of harmful chemicals, which is better
                for both people and the environment.

                <br> 
                Some of the contacts we plan on reaching out in the near future include:-
