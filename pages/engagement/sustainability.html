      <p>
  Our project addresses environmental and social challenges associated with
  conventional fragrance ingredient production by aligning with the United Nations
  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production</li>
  <li>SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure</li>
  <li>SDG 15: Life on Land</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Current petrochemical synthesis routes and plant-extractive pathways for
  fragrance molecules, especially p-cuminaldehyde, involve high energy demand,
  harsh chemical reagents, contamination of water bodies, and significant cumin
  crop waste. These challenges highlight the need for sustainable production
  methods that reduce waste and resource consumption while remaining economically
  feasible.
</p>

<p>
  We engaged with multiple academic experts, fragrance manufacturers, farmers,
  and consumers, whose feedback provided valuable insights that informed the
  development of this project. These interactions helped us gain a deeper
  understanding of existing production methods, industry trends, and the
  practical feasibility of our approach.
</p>

<p>
  Both the positive and negative aspects of our proposed solution were carefully
  considered to ensure that it is economically realistic while remaining aligned
  with the SDGs.
</p>
<h2>SDG 12</h2>
<div class="dividerbar"></div>
<div class="image-and-caption">
    <img src="s1.jpeg" alt="">
</div>
<p>Our project replaces the resource-intensive current methods of production with a more sustainable, biological production method- engineering a bacterium Pseudomonas Putida to biosynthesise a fragrance molecule, p-cuminaldehyde. Our method of production offers enhanced sustainability over conventional industrial processes, as it lowers energy demand, limits the use of harsh chemicals, and decreases downstream waste treatment requirements.
From our interactions with suppliers, experts and consumers, we have understood that the main criteria for indian suppliers is reduced cost along with improved quality, so most of the current production methods are not focused on sustainability.  A major amount of these are also imported due to this reason, so our project would have a strong market in India since we aim to combine both sustainability as well as economical feasibility. </p>
<h2>SDG 9</h2>
<div class="dividerbar"></div>
<div class="image-and-caption">
    <img src="s2.jpeg" alt="">
</div>
<p>Through our HP and iHP contacts, we were able to gain a wider perspective of the infrastructure surrounding aldehydes and other significant aromatic compounds. Through these interactions we realised that while aldehyde usage at the industry scale is dwindling, it is still widely used in the incense industry, which has helped us shift our focus to an area of higher impact.
As for scaling up, while we do not have a detailed plan, we did receive helpful inputs from Dr. Prabha Hegde on the challenges that we will need to consider when we do so. 
<br><br>
We propose a bioengineered pathway for the sustainable production of p-cumic aldehyde, a key fragrance molecule that serves as a precursor for multiple downstream fragrance compounds. Through controlled chemical reactions, p-cuminaldehyde can be converted into a range of fragrance molecules with distinct olfactory profiles.
<br><br>
This platform-based approach introduces process innovation by enabling the synthesis of multiple end products from a single common intermediate, thereby reducing the need for multiple independent production routes. As a result, the process minimizes the generation of waste by-products and lowers the overall consumption of raw materials.<br><br>

All of these elements come together to reduce waste treatment procedures, optimize process efficiency, and reduce costs, thus facilitating more sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective industrial methods for fragrance production with regard to SDG 9.
</p>
<h2>SDG 15</h2>
<div class="dividerbar"></div>
<div class="image-and-caption">
    <img src="s3.jpeg" alt="">
</div>
<p>Our team’s approach to synthesizing cuminaldehyde directly eliminates the need to extract the substance through unsustainable methods, directly conserving terrestrial ecosystems from conversion to aromatic crop production farms. The process of production would occur in controlled bioreactors, taking pressure off of the land and other associated ecosystems. This route terminates the economic incentive to produce such crops on land. 
<br><br>
The organism harnesses its innate pathway through genetic engineering, thereby supporting inclusive value chains and implementation in the biotechnological sectors.  The cultivation of aromatic compounds leads to severe land degradation including the loss of soil carbon. Our innovation creates an opportunity for land restoration.
