      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>The work that we do  is deeply inspired by India’s gurukul tradition, where learning was shared 
        with care, humility, and responsibility toward society and nature. Knowledge was meant to be passed 
        on and used for the greater good, and this spirit continues to guide how we approach education, science, 
        and sustainability.
        <br><br>
          As students of synthetic biology and biotechnology, we see education as both a privilege and a 
          responsibility. From the gurukul to modern classrooms, learning in India has always been open and 
          connected to everyday life. Inspired by this legacy, we believe science should be shared in simple and 
          welcoming ways.
        <br><br>
        Through this we aim to show how sustainable science can protect natural resources while preserving the 
        fragrances people love because to us education is the root from which a thoughtful future grows.
        <br><br>
        To effectively reach our audience, we have designed an educational approach tailored to specific age 
        groups, refining their understanding and perspective on synthetic biology and biotechnology in general.</p>

      <h2>Primary School Students</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>These sessions will be designed to spark curiosity through sensory-based learning while building 
        foundational awareness of science and biotechnology. Students will be introduced to basic scientific 
        concepts in a simple and engaging manner, with a focus on where smells and perfumes come from. Through 
        everyday examples, they will explore the difference between natural sources and human-made products, 
        helping them connect abstract ideas to their daily experiences
          <br><br>
        Activities will include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><u>Smell and guess games: </u>Students will identify familiar scents (such as spices, flowers, 
            or fruits) and share where they think these smells come from.</li>
          <li><u>Design-your-own perfume activity:</u> Students will draw and name their own perfume, choosing 
            scents they like and imagining what ingredients might be used, encouraging creativity and personal 
            expression.</li>
          <li><u>“Good microbes” introduction: </u> Friendly visuals and characters will be used to explain how tiny 
            living organisms can help make useful products.</li>
        </ul>

          
     
      <h2>Middle School Students</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>These sessions will emphasize concept building through interactive learning. Students will 
        be introduced to biotechnology and its major branches, followed by an introduction to fundamental 
        synthetic biology concepts such as genes, enzymes, and biological pathways. Sustainability will 
        be explored by helping students understand why excessive plant use and resource extraction can pose 
        significant environmental challenges.
        <br><br>
        Activities will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><u>“Biotech in My Day” mapping activity: </u> Students will map everyday products (soap, food, 
          perfumes, medicines) to the biological or biotechnological processes behind them</li>
        <li><u>Smell to Molecule: </u> Students will match a familiar scent to a simplified molecular structure.</li>
        <li><u>Animation Video: </u> Short animated videos explaining bio-based and microbial production processes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>High School / College Students</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>These sessions will center on real-world applications, ethics, and sustainability. Students will be 
        introduced to synthetic biology concepts such as pathway modification and metabolic engineering, 
        followed by an overview of our project on the bio-based production of aromatic aldehydes. Traditional 
        extraction methods will be compared with sustainable, bio-based alternatives to help students critically 
        evaluate their environmental, economic, and ethical implications.
      <br><br>
        Activities will include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Myth vs Fact discussion: </u> Common myths about biotechnology and synthetic biology will be 
          presented, followed by group discussions to separate misconceptions from scientific reality.Common myths 
          about biotechnology and synthetic biology will be presented, followed by group discussions to separate 
          misconceptions from scientific reality.</li>
        <li><u>Guided debates on sustainability and sourcing: </u> Students will discuss questions such as whether 
          fragrances should come from plants or be produced using microbes, considering environmental impact and 
          resource use.</li>
        <li><u>Real World Impact: </u> Case studies highlighting biotechnology-driven solutions to real-world challenges</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Additional Potential Outreach and Engagement Activities</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <h4>Scholarly outreach through CoreSpin</h4>
      <p>We will explore publishing a review article in <a href="https://2025.igem.wiki/msp-maastricht/education">CoreSpin’s Vector Journal</a>,
        focusing on a novel approach in synthetic biology, preferably through insights from our future research unit.</p>

      <h4>Inter-iGEM collaboration within India</h4>
      <p>We plan to reach out to other iGEM teams across India to explore opportunities for collaboration, including co-created brochures, 
        shared educational content, or creating a journal of our own and inviting other iGEM teams ( preferably indian iGEM teams) 
        to contribute to it.</p>

      <h4>Development of animated educational content</h4>
      <p>An animated video will be developed to communicate any one of core concepts or applications of synthetic biology 
        in an engaging and accessible format for a broader audience.</p>

      <h4>Open debates and expert talks</h4>
      <p>We will aim to host an open discussion or invited talk in collaboration with platforms such as BLANK 101 or 
        IEBT, ideally centered around synthetic biology applications in terpenoids or aroma compounds.</p>

      <h4>Science education through social media</h4>
      <p>Educational content will be disseminated through social media platforms to increase awareness, address 
        misconceptions, and engage younger audiences in synthetic biology and biotechnology.</p>

      <h4>Industry and sponsor engagement through TechTatva</h4>
      <p>We will try using The Manipal Entrepreneurship Summit as a platform to pitch our project to industry 
        representatives and potential sponsors, while also gathering valuable feedback to refine our project 
        drawing inspiration from initiatives such as <a href="Education | DTU-Denmark - iGEM 2025">Education | DTU-Denmark – iGEM 2025.</a></p>
