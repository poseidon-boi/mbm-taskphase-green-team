      <h2>Problem Statment</h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>Natural cuminaldehyde mainly comes from cumin essential oil, where it often makes up a large part of the volatile profile. However, it’s extraction process, limits yield and creates a lot of waste. Studies on cumin seeds in biorefineries report total essential oil yields of about 1.6 to 2.9% (Merah et al., 2020), which depends on the region and farming conditions.  
        <br><br>
        Steam or hydrodistillation is still the standard method in industry for extracting cumin oil. However, detailed studies show that both oil yield and composition are very sensitive to how the seeds are ground, packed, and how flow conditions are managed. In one steam distillation study, essential oil yields after 120 minutes ranged from roughly 0.79 to 2.36 units across different conditions (Zheljazkov et al., 2015). Increased grinding led to more total oil being released but also significantly reduced the percentage of cuminaldehyde in the oil (Sharma et al., 2016). These process sensitivities make quality control in perfumery difficult since the same crop can produce different amounts of aldehyde and varying profiles of other compounds based on how the plant material is treated and distilled. 
        <br><br>
        In addition to variability in yields, the traditional cumin value chain produces a lot of leftover biomass that often goes underused. Reviews on how to manage leftover biomass from spices and medicinal plants point out that distillation leaves behind large amounts of de-oiled cakes and liquid residues. These byproducts usually don’t have high-value uses, even though they contain bioactive compounds. Even when there are secondary uses, such as using black cumin cake to make biosurfactants, it remains a process that extracts only a small portion of valuable volatiles while creating significant solid and liquid waste (Łopusiewicz et al., 2022).  
        <br><br>
        Petrochemical methods for making cuminaldehyde and related fragrance compounds also face challenges. Multi-step processes using petrochemical benzene derivatives often rely on strong acids or bases and Lewis acid catalysts like TiCl<sub>₄</sub>, BF<sub>₃</sub>·Et<sub>₂</sub>O, or SnCl<sub>₄</sub>. These methods create corrosive waste and large amounts of contaminated water during cleanup. A recent review of the fragrance industry’s shift towards greener production notes that these methods contribute to resource depletion and carbon emissions. They are increasingly out of step with sustainability goals and consumer expectations for cleaner sourcing (Bihanic et al., 2021).

      <h2>Our Solution </h2>
      <div class="dividerbar"></div>
      <p>We engineer the soil bacterium <em><em>Pseudomonas putida</em></em> as our primary biological tool. <em>P. putida</em> is known as one of the most robust and genetically easy hosts for industrial biotechnology involving aromatic hydrocarbons and solvent-like compounds (Singh, S. et al., 2021). Importantly, the oxidation of <em>p</em>-cymene to <em>p</em>-cuminaldehyde and related compounds is naturally present in environmental bacteria. This gives us a proven metabolic entry point instead of needing to build the whole pathway from scratch (Samandari-Bahraseman, M. R., et al., 2025). In <em>P. putida</em>, the natural <em>p</em>-cymene oxidation system combines with a high tolerance to membrane stress, oxidative conditions, and hydrophobic substances. This makes the organism particularly suited for managing reactive aldehyde intermediates that microbes usually struggle to accumulate (Eaton, R. G., 1997).
      <br><br>
      The key design principle of our project is to redirect aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism to build up aldehydes. In nature, the <em>p</em>-cymene pathway changes <em>p</em>-cuminaldehyde to an acid via the terminal aldehyde dehydrogenase CymC, sending the substrate into central metabolism (Defrabjm J.J., Ribbons, D. W., 1977). Our approach stops this pathway by removing the final oxidation step. This turns a normally temporary product inside the cell into something we can recover while still allowing for efficient conversion and enzyme activity upstream (Benchteam Team, 2025).  
    <br><br>
    The upstream enzymes in the pathway sequentially convert <em>p</em>-cymene to <em>p</em>-cuminaldehyde, which due to its small size and hydrophobic nature, is expected to move out of the aqueous phase. To further reduce aldehyde toxicity and allow for ongoing product recovery, our method includes a whole cell encapsulation strategy combined with a biphasic extraction system. This strategy shortens the time that compounds spend inside the cell, simplifies purification steps, and connects biological production to larger industrial processes (Dominika Ciurko, et al. 2023).  
        <br><br>
        Once extracted, <em>p</em>-cuminaldehyde acts as a useful chemical intermediate rather than just an end product. Through gentle, well-known chemical processes, we can change it into cyclamen aldehyde and other fragrance compounds like lily-of-the-valley, jasmine, and spicy-floral aldehydes. This flexible bio–chemo design shows that our system can extend beyond a single target compound and demonstrates how engineered microbial metabolism can work with green chemistry to access a wider range of non-terpenoid aroma chemicals (Loreine Agullo, et al., 2017).  
        <br><br>Overall, this platform shows how we can overcome the long-standing issue of aldehyde toxicity in biological systems by intercepting pathways, carefully choosing feedstock, and using flexible downstream chemistry. By using a renewable aromatic substrate and a tolerant microbial host, our approach reduces dependence on petrochemical methods and wasteful plant extraction. This aligns with sustainability goals and highlights how synthetic biology can change the production of speciality chemicals.
